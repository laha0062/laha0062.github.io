            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, as stated within the header my name is Iain Lahaie and I moved to Ottawa in April to attend the Interactive Media Design program.<br> So far I have enjoyed living in Ottawa seeing as the small town I lived in previously was quite boring so the added activities are a huge perk.<br> I also recently had my 19<sup>th</sup> birthday, though I haven't really been using all of the perks that come with it. 
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a few hobbies that I am quite passionate about, one of them being music. I began playing guitar 5 years ago and It very quickly became one of my favourite ways to pass time.<br> I enjoy both playing and listening to a wide variety of genres with my absolute <strong>favourites</strong> being <em>Punk</em> and <em>Metal</em>. Aside from music I also began reading Novels again and am currently reading through the <abbr title="Lord of the Rings">LOTR</abbr> novels. 
            </p>
